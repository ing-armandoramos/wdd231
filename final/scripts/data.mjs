    "name": "Pomodoro Technique",
    "time_to_learn_minutes": 60,
    "time_in_pomodoros": 3,
    "author": "Francesco Cirillo",
    "photo_url": "images/active.svg",
    "instructions": "The Pomodoro Technique improves focus by breaking work into 25-minute intervals (Pomodoros) followed by 5-minute breaks. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). Use a timer to enforce this structure. Ideal for tasks requiring sustained concentration, it combats procrastination and mental fatigue. Adjust intervals slightly if needed (e.g., 50/10 for deep work). Avoid distractions during Pomodoros—silence notifications and track interruptions to improve over time."

    "name": "Feynman Technique",
    "time_to_learn_minutes": 90,
    "time_in_pomodoros": 4,
    "author": "Richard Feynman",
    "photo_url": "images/cornell.svg",
    "instructions": "The Feynman Technique simplifies complex topics by teaching them in plain language. Steps: 1) Study a concept, 2) Explain it as if to a beginner, 3) Identify gaps in your understanding, 4) Review and simplify further. Use analogies and avoid jargon. This method reveals weaknesses in knowledge and strengthens retention. Ideal for exam prep or mastering technical subjects."

    "name": "Spaced Repetition",
    "time_to_learn_minutes": 120,
    "time_in_pomodoros": 5,
    "author": "Hermann Ebbinghaus",
    "photo_url": "images/deepwork.svg",
    "instructions": "Spaced repetition leverages memory decay by reviewing material at increasing intervals. Use apps like Anki or a planner to schedule reviews: shortly after learning, then days/weeks later. Focus on challenging material more frequently. Effective for language learning, medical studies, or retaining large volumes of information. Consistency is key—dedicate 10-20 minutes daily."

  {
    "name": "Active Recall",
    "time_to_learn_minutes": 90,
    "time_in_pomodoros": 4,
    "author": "Learning Scientists",
    "photo_url": "images/eisenhower.svg",
    "instructions": "Active recall boosts retention by self-testing instead of passive review. After reading, close your notes and write or recite key points. Use flashcards, practice questions, or teach the material aloud. Struggling to recall strengthens memory. Ideal for exams—study early and test often."

  {
    "name": "Leitner System",
    "time_to_learn_minutes": 60,
    "time_in_pomodoros": 3,
    "author": "Sebastian Leitner",
    "photo_url": "images/feynman.svg",
    "instructions": "The Leitner System organizes flashcards into boxes reviewed at different frequencies. Correct answers move cards to higher boxes (longer intervals); incorrect ones return to Box 1. Optimizes study time by focusing on weaker areas. Use physical cards or apps like Anki. Best for vocabulary, formulas, or facts."

    "time_in_pomodoros": 2,
    "author": "Francis P. Robinson",
    "photo_url": "images/flowtime.svg",
    "instructions": "SQ3R enhances textbook reading: 1) **Survey** headings/images, 2) **Question** by turning headings into queries, 3) **Read** to answer questions, 4) **Recite** key points aloud, 5) **Review** notes. Improves comprehension and retention. Ideal for dense academic material."

    "time_in_pomodoros": 3,
    "author": "Walter Pauk",
    "photo_url": "images/gtd.svg",
    "instructions": "Cornell Notes divide pages into three sections: 1) Main notes, 2) Cues (key questions/keywords), 3) Summary. After class, review and fill cues/summary. Test yourself by covering the notes. Great for lectures—promotes active engagement and easy review."

    "name": "Mind Mapping",
    "time_to_learn_minutes": 60,
    "time_in_pomodoros": 3,
    "author": "Tony Buzan",
    "photo_url": "images/mindmaping.svg",
    "instructions": "Mind maps visualize ideas hierarchically. Start with a central topic, branch into subtopics, and use keywords, colors, and images. Helps brainstorm, organize thoughts, or summarize books. Use paper or apps like XMind. Best for creative projects or visual learners."

    "time_in_pomodoros": 7,
    "author": "Cal Newport",
    "photo_url": "images/pareto.svg",
    "instructions": "Deep Work means undistracted, high-concentration sessions (1-4 hours). Eliminate interruptions (turn off notifications), set clear goals, and work in a quiet space. Schedule sessions in advance and track progress. Ideal for complex tasks like coding, writing, or research."

    "author": "Benjamin Franklin (popular moderno)",
    "photo_url": "images/timeblocking.svg",
    "instructions": "Time blocking assigns specific tasks to fixed time slots in your calendar. Prioritize high-impact work first, include breaks, and limit multitasking. Use tools like Google Calendar or planners. Adapt blocks as needed—prevents overcommitment and boosts productivity."

    "author": "Dwight D. Eisenhower",
    "photo_url": "images/pomodoro.svg",
    "instructions": "The Eisenhower Matrix prioritizes tasks by urgency/importance: 1) **Do Now** (urgent/important), 2) **Schedule** (important/not urgent), 3) **Delegate** (urgent/unimportant), 4) **Eliminate** (neither). Use daily/weekly to focus on what truly matters."
